# TransFundr - Frontend

This is the frontend for the [TransFundr website](http://www.transfundr.com). TransFundr is a crowdfunding website for trans women -- what makes this app unique is a point system, offering points in exchange for donations, which you can show off on your profile page as a user who donates.

[This](https://github.com/LucySuddenly/transfundr-backend) is a link the the backend repository.

## Motivation

From the About page of the site: TransFundr was built by a white trans woman to facilitate and reward donations to struggling trans women, especially trans women of color. Trans women are at high risk of joblessness, homelessness, assault, and societal exclusion. The risks are especially compounded for trans women of color, with most violent assaults being directed at them. Point multipliers reflect these realities, encouraging donations to flow to trans women of color. Sort methods also prioritize trans women of color ahead of white trans women.

Allies: Create an account on TransFundr. Donate directly through Venmo, Paypal, CashApp or Zelle, then add your donation on TransFundr. When your donation is confirmed by the receiver, you get points. Depending on who the receiver of your donation, you get a multiplier applied to the number of points you get: white trans women get no multiplier, trans women of color get X2
